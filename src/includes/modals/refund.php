                <h6 class="text-gold mt-4">1. Introduction</h6>
                <p>This Cancellation & Refund Policy outlines the terms for cancelling your booking with Aperture ("we," "us," or "our"). By booking our Services, you ("the Client") agree to this policy. We understand that plans can change, and we aim to handle cancellations fairly for both parties.</p>

                <h6 class="text-gold mt-4">2. Booking Deposit</h6>
                <p>To confirm your booking, a deposit of <strong>30%</strong> of your chosen package's total price is required. This secures your event date and covers our initial administrative and planning costs.</p>

                <h6 class="text-gold mt-4">3. Cancellation by Client</h6>
                <p>We accept cancellations for any reason.</p>
                <p>If you choose to cancel your booking, the following refund structure will apply:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The refund will be calculated as 40% of the total amount you have paid to date.</strong></li>
                    <li>The remaining 60% of the amount paid will be retained by Aperture as a cancellation fee to compensate for the reserved date and costs incurred.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="alert alert-secondary bg-transparent border-secondary text-light">
                    <strong>Example for Clarity:</strong><br>
                    Your Package Total: ₱20,000<br>
                    30% Deposit Paid: ₱6,000<br>
                    If you cancel after paying the deposit, your refund is <strong>40% of ₱6,000 = ₱2,400</strong>.
                </div>

                <h6 class="text-gold mt-4">4. Cancellation by Aperture</h6>
                <p>In the highly unlikely event that we must cancel your booking due to extraordinary circumstances on our part (e.g., severe illness, accident) where a replacement provider cannot be secured, you will receive a <strong>refund of 40% of the total amount you have paid</strong>, consistent with our standard cancellation terms.</p>

                <h6 class="text-gold mt-4">5. How to Request a Cancellation & Refund</h6>
                <p>To cancel your booking, please log in to your account on our website and navigate to your <strong>Booking Page</strong>. From there, you can submit a cancellation and refund request directly through the system.</p>
                <p>Once approved, your refund will be processed within <strong>15–30 business days</strong> and issued through your original payment method.</p>

                <h6 class="text-gold mt-4">6. Rescheduling</h6>
                <p>If you wish to move your event to a new date instead of cancelling, you may reschedule your booking <strong>once</strong>, subject to our availability. This can also be managed through the booking page on our website.</p>
